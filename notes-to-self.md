# Issues
## Overview / portal
The two keywords that describes my first interaction with Cucumber is confused and overwhelmed.

- There are simply too many things in different places and I have no idea how it all fits together.
- There are links that is hidden or takes you to a different place than expected, leaving you confused or give up totally.  For example new contributors are guided to a slack channel that is not available until you're invited.
- The intro video is very long and covers things that relates to general open source projects, not just Cucumber, making it very confusing.  Suggest to break it into shorter video's covering one topic each so that people can more easily find the parts they are looking for.
+ On the positive side, there is a super welcoming group of humans to jump in and immediately help you get started.  Felt very welcome.
